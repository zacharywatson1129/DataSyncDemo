# MessageTransferDemo
Demo for transferring text data between Maui app and a simple console app via ASP.Net Core Web API.

At current, the console app starts up web API. In near future, Maui or Xamarin app will call the api also.
Then, some way to publish messages or update a sample database will be figured out.
